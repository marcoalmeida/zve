check output: has everything executed as expected when processing FOO?

improve output: don't use os.system() because it always writes to
stdout; coherent naming (zone -> VM), -H flag for easier parsing with
other tools

shell_execute() should return separate strings for stdout and stderr
in order to make error detection and handling easier; change with
care: this breaks compatibility

all subcommands must end with silent output if and only if no error
occurred (unless verbose output is requested)
